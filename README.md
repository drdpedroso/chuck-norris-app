## Chuck Norris Joke Application

### About
The goal of this project is to fetch Chuck Norris' Jokes and display then in a list.
You can favorite those jokes and place then into another list (called favorite jokes).
You're also able to favorite/unfavorite those jokes.

This project uses `React`, `ES6` and `Lodash` as "core" libraries. For testing, it uses `Jest`,
`rosie` and `enzyme`.

#### Pattern
The project structure follows something similar to `Fractal` project structure (differing only in the naming convention).
The code style follows the `AirBnB` JavaScript pattern with some smaller changes that I considered more readable (check `.eslintrc`).
 

### How to run it
Simply run `npm install` to install the dependencies and `npm start` to start the development server
at `http://localhost:9000/`

### Tests
Simply run `npm t`. I'm using factory-based tests with `rosie` to make it easier to write the tests.
